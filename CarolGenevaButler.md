**From her obituary:**

She loved animals. As a little girl she would often climb the fence around the mission home to reach an animal she could pet.
She loved animals throughout her life, including her dogs Buster and Sweetie and her cat Pumpkin.

She had served as a CNA in a Seattle hospital where she showed deep respect and compassion for the sick and suffering.
